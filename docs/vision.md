# LandChain Vision

## Mission
To transition India from **Presumptive Titling** (where deeds are just receipts) to **Conclusive Titling** (where the blockchain record is the law).

## The Problem
- **Double Spending**: The same land is sold to multiple people.
- **Encumbrance Fraud**: Mortgaged land is sold without the Bank's knowledge.
- **Mutation Lag**: The "Sale Deed" happens today, but the "Revenue Record" update takes months.

## The Solution: "Code is Law"
LandChain proposes a "Permissioned Blockchain" where:
1.  **The Government** is the Validator.
2.  **The Code** is the Registrar.
3.  **The Record** is the Title.

## Core Vibe
- **Gov-Tech 3.0**: Minimalist, fast, and transparent.
- **Atomic**: Transaction + Mutation = Instant Ownership.
- **Verify, Don't Trust**: Every citizen can verify the entire history of a plot in 2 seconds.
